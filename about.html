                    <div class="about-content">
                        <p class="about-general">Originally from northern Russia, I started my journey to UX / HTI field in August 2016 by becoming a master degree student at Tampere University (formerly Tampere University of Technology). Being passionate about user-centered and graphic design and design research, I always strive for details and simple, but creative solutions.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        So far I managed to participate in a couple of fairly big projects such as <a href="bus.html">Living Lab Bus</a>, where I was mostly focusing on developer experience, and  <a href="gover.html">worked with</a> Intopalo on data governance tool. I also dabble at digital art and spend my spare time creating environmental digital paintings and sketches or practicing visual design.
                        <br><br>
                        I recently have been graduated from Tampere University and currently I am searching for job openings related to UX/UI design and research. I want to join the team of fellow designers and developers where I can enhance my skills, solve interesting and complex problems, meet new fascinating people and learn new technologies and methodologies.
